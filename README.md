# Recommendation Engine — BookHaven (Experimental)

This repository contains an **experimental recommendation system scaffold** designed to support the BookHaven bookstore.

It focuses on **data flow, service separation, and recommendation strategy experimentation** — not UI completeness.

## What This Is

✔️ Backend recommendation service prototype  
✔️ Multiple recommendation strategies (collaborative, content, graph)  
✔️ A/B testing and event logging foundations  

---

## What This Is NOT

❌ A production-ready ML system  
❌ A complete storefront  
❌ A finished product  

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL (user/product data)
- Neo4j (graph recommendations)
- Oracle (experimental / learning purpose)

---

## Why This Exists

This project explores:
- Recommendation system architecture
- Cross-database integration complexity
- Over-engineering risks
- Evaluation and logging strategies

Oracle was intentionally included to **study cost and complexity tradeoffs**, not because it is required.

---

## Current Capabilities

- Unified recommendation endpoint
- Strategy-based routing
- Event logging (clicks, impressions)
- A/B model assignment

---

## Future Work

- Integration with flagship BookHaven UI
- Recommendation quality metrics
- Batch processing
- Model evaluation pipelines

---

## Status
🧪 Experimental  
⚠️ Not production ready
